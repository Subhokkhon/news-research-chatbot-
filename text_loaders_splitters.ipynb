If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued, and its future return is likely to be poor.

NVIDIA's cash-to-debt ratio of 1.27 is worse than 58.04% of companies in the Semiconductors industry. However, NVIDIA's overall financial strength is 8 out of 10, indicating a strong financial position.\n",

The company's operating margin of 17.37% ranks better than 76.5% of companies in the Semiconductors industry.\n",
